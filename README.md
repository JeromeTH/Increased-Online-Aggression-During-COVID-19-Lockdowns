Basic Description 
This project uses neural network based BERT model to analyze the trends of aggressive emotions on Twitter between 2019/1/1 and 2020/10/1. During the 92 weeks in this period, there is data for the count and proportion of aggressive tweets for each of the 50 US states. Using this data, we applied the Difference in Differences analysis to estimate the causal affect between lockdown and increasing aggression.
